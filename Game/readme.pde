Brief description of the game developed:
This game involves the user colliding with all of the moving balls in the quickest time possible.
The user must use the arrow keys or W, A, S, D keys to move their player.
Each game increases in difficulty with extra balls being added, as well as the balls being smaller in size and travelling at faster speeds.
When all of the games have been completed, the user's times are displayed and their average time is calculated.
